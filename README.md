# Sliver-C2
## <u>Intro:</u>
This repo is created to show how to install and use the [Sliver Comannd-and-Control framework from Bishop Fox](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) on Kali linux.

Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework, it can be used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing. Sliver's implants support C2 over Mutual TLS (mTLS), WireGuard, HTTP(S), and DNS and are dynamically compiled with per-binary asymmetric encryption keys.

## <u>Background:</u>

A [Youtube author Melvin Langvik, @Flangvik](https://www.youtube.com/@Flangvik) created a series where he reviewed a number of Command-and-Control frameworks. 

FYI, Melvin is a Red Teamer on the "Targeted Operations Team" at [TrustedSec](https://www.trustedsec.com/). He has a strong background as a C# developer. He lives in Norway, Europe. Mevin also has a [github site](https://github.com/Flangvik).

Based on his ["Checking out Sliver C2"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R6WKUgN0K4), I deceided to give it try on Kali, and in particular on the setup from my repo [Active Directoy Lab Setup](https://github.com/jjkirn/active-directory).


Thank you Melvin for inspiring me create these notes!
